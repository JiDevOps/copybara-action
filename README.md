[![copybara](https://github.com/wilmol/copybara-action/workflows/copybara/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wilmol/copybara-action/actions?query=workflow%3Acopybara)

(WIP) GitHub Action that runs [Copybara](https://github.com/google/copybara)

## How it works
* Currently, this repo shows how you can run Copybara in GitHub Actions
* It uses docker to pull and run [this image](https://hub.docker.com/r/sharelatex/copybara)
* See the [workflow file](.github/workflows/copybara.yml) for more details

## TODO
* Turn this into a proper GitHub Action
